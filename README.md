# PythonExcelGoogleSheets
Excel and google sheets connected with python

Small script written in python3 that does the following:
  - Connects with google sheets using gspread
  - clears the contents of the google sheet page
  - opens an excel file and saves the data in a list (or two)
  - adds the data from the excel file into the google sheets
  
Potential use cases:
  - Automation of daily updates that otherwise must be done manually
  - linking spreadsheets from local machine with a shared google sheet
  - Many other (depending on the scope and modifications of the script)
